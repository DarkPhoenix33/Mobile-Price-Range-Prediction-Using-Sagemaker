## End to End ML Project to Predict Mobile prices range using Random Forest and AWS SageMaker

In this project we will be creating an end to end ML project that takes data stored in S3 and uses sagemaker service to train the data and deploy it on a server (Sagemaker endpoint) for inferencing purposes. Following AWS services are being used for this project:

# 1. AWS S3
# 2. AWS SageMaker
# 3. IAM 

Note: We will be using boto3 library and aws cli for all our tasks so that we can manage all the things programmatically
